# HookChecker
Check if a function is hooked based on verifying the bytes in memory against those in the original file and (if needed) attempt to recover.

can check and recover:
- inline hooking
- breakpoint hooking (INT3)
- hardware breakpoint hooking
- IAT hooking

not thoroughly tested so have fun debugging ;))
